Project name: Twitter Tweet Tracker
  Twitter Tweet Tracker takes in tweet and follower data from individuals and generates a five-personality model, six emotion model,
  subjectivity bar, frequency table, and various tweet charts. This application is deisgned to identify at risk or unsable twitter users.
  Using word analysis and key context clues, we can create a model of a twitter user who might be experiencing distress and other abnormal
  emotional spikes. Because of the rapid nature of twitter, it can be hard for individuals to keep track of their friends when they need
  them the most. Thus, this application can help users in keeping up with their friends over larger periods of time.
